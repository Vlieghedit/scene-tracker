# Cross-Device Data Sync Solution

## Problem Solved

Your episode tracker webapp currently uses localStorage, which means:
- Data is only stored on the current device/browser
- Data is not accessible from other computers
- Data is lost if you clear browser data

## Solution Implemented

I've implemented a **hybrid storage system** that:

1. **Uses Supabase** (cloud database) when configured
2. **Falls back to localStorage** when Supabase is not available
3. **Saves to both** for maximum reliability

## What's New

### Files Added:
- `src/supabase.js` - Supabase client configuration
- `src/storageService.js` - Hybrid storage service
- `SUPABASE-SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- `env.example` - Environment variables template

### Files Modified:
- `src/App.jsx` - Updated to use async storage service
- `package.json` - Added Supabase dependency

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Detection**: The app checks if Supabase is configured
2. **Cloud Storage**: If configured, data is saved to Supabase database
3. **Local Backup**: Data is also saved to localStorage as backup
4. **Fallback**: If Supabase fails, the app continues with localStorage
5. **Cross-Device Sync**: Data from Supabase is accessible from any device

## Benefits

✅ **Cross-device access** - View your data from any computer  
✅ **No data loss** - Cloud backup prevents data loss  
✅ **Offline support** - App works even without internet  
✅ **Automatic sync** - Changes appear instantly across devices  
✅ **Free tier** - Supabase has generous free limits  
✅ **Backward compatible** - Existing localStorage data is preserved  

## Quick Setup

1. **Create Supabase account** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Create a new project** and get your API keys
3. **Set up database tables** (see SUPABASE-SETUP.md)
4. **Add environment variables** to Netlify
5. **Deploy** - Your app will now sync across devices!

## Cost

- **Supabase**: Free tier includes 500MB database, 50,000 monthly active users
- **Netlify**: Your existing hosting remains free
- **Total**: $0/month for typical usage

## Security

- Uses Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS)
- Anonymous access for simplicity
- Can add user authentication later if needed
- API keys are safe for client-side use

## Next Steps

1. Follow the `SUPABASE-SETUP.md` guide
2. Test the sync by using the app on different devices
3. Consider adding user authentication for multi-user support
4. Add data export/import features

## Support

If you need help:
- Check the browser console for errors
- Verify your Supabase configuration
- The app will continue working with localStorage if anything fails
- See SUPABASE-SETUP.md for detailed troubleshooting
